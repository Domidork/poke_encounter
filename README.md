Setup: 
  1) unzip the files to anywhere you see fit
  2) run 'python3 main.py --link' to link the file to home
  3) run ~/poke --help to get a small usage guide
  4) have fun!

Special commands: '--help' and '--link'
  --link: creates a symlink to the home directory so that the program can be run from anywhere using '~/poke'
  --help: prints a brief usage guide to the console
